<p id="below">Håvard Elgsaas: In our MUF room (Musikk fordypning) with Mac PCs,
  each one with a MIDI-keyboard for music production and composing.
  We also had only one toilet in the basement for males,
  and one for females in the main building at Foss VGS.</p>


  <p id="belowY">Yasmin N. Garcia Avalo: I attended to an adult High school program in Oslo. I had many different cultures among my classmates.
    It was a rich environment of different people of different ages that were working hard
    to build a future for them selfs and their families. This environment made it much easier and motivating to work hard, because I also dream with a better and more energetically sustainable life style.</p>
