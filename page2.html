<p>In our MUF room (Music in depth), we had a lot of Mac PCs,
  each one with a MIDI keyboard for music production and composing.
  We also had only two toilets in the basement. One for males
  and one for females in the main building at Foss VGS.</p>

  <p> I attended an adult High school program in Oslo. I had many different cultures among my classmates. It was a rich environment of different kinds of people, 
    each person of different ages. They were working hard to build a future for themselves and their families.
     </p>

  <p>This environment made it easy, fun and additionally motivating to work hard because I also dream of a better and more energetically sustainable lifestyle.</p>
